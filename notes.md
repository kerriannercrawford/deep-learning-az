# What is Deep Learning? 
- neural networks along w deep learning have been around for quite some time
- have only started impacting the world now
- technology back then was not up to the standards to facilitate neural networks 
- need data and a LOT of data
- need processing power 
- scientists are looking into using DNA for storage 
- we're entering the era of computers that are super powerful and can process faster than we can even imagine. this is facilitating deep learning 

## Geoffrey Hinton: Godfather of Deep Learning
- did research in the 1980s 
- published
- works at google

## Deep Learning
- trying to mimic human brain and recreate it
- create an artificial structure where we have "nodes" or "neurons" 
- input values start predictions 
- input layer -> hidden layer -> output layer
- each input is connected to each hidden layer and each hidden layer goes to output
- "deep" learning when lots and lots of hidden layers
